# PULSAR-DATA: A Corpora of Human Rights Reports, Press Releases, and Blog Posts

This is a repository to hold the raw data as part of the Parsing Unstructured Language into Sentiment-Aspect Representations (PULSAR) project. 

Here you will find raw text, pdf, and html files from over 100 human rights non-governmental organizations (HRNGOs). 

The data collection and parsing was made possible by funding from the National Science Foundation and the University of Pittsburgh Center for Research Computer.
